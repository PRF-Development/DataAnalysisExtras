    "Automatic Differentiation, also known as autodiff or AD, is a computational technique for efficiently and accurately computing derivatives of functions.\n",
    "It is particularly useful for functions that are defined by computer programs or algorithms.\n",
    "AutoDiff is based on the chain rule from calculus.\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Forward-mode AutoDiff:* This method computes the derivative of a function with respect to one input variable at a time. It is efficient when the number of input variables is relatively small compared to the number of functions to be evaluated.\n",
    "- *Reverse-mode AutoDiff (Backpropagation):* This method computes the derivatives of all output variables with respect to a single input variable simultaneously. It is particularly efficient when the number of output variables is much larger than the number of input variables, which is common in machine learning and neural network training.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoDiff is widely used in optimization problems and machine learning, where gradients (derivatives) are essential for training algorithms like gradient descent."

    "\n",
    "Finite Differences is a numerical method for approximating derivatives by using the values of a function at discrete points.\n",
    "It is a simple and intuitive approach but is generally less accurate than AutoDiff or Symbolic Differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to calculate the derivative by dividing the change in the function's value ($\\delta y$) by the change in the input variable ($\\delta x$).\n",
    "There are several finite difference schemes, including forward differences, backward differences, and central differences, depending on how the neighboring points are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the forward difference approximation for the derivative of a function *f(x)* at a point $x$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + \\delta x) - f(x)}{\\delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Differences are straightforward to implement and can be used when you have access to the function's values but not its analytical expression.\n",
    "They are commonly used in numerical analysis and scientific computing for problems where symbolic differentiation is impractical or too costly.\n",
    "It is also used when the function of interest is a \"black box\"."
